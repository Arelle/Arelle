[Arelle](http://arelle.org/) is a project to provide an easy to use open source facility for XBRL.

The intent began to meet needs that are not commercially viable, such as to
support under-development extension modules and test suite facilities, in a
compact framework, and to support academic training and projects.

Features
========
* Support for XBRL versioning.
Validation tool for versioning reports and a production tool to generate the basics of a
versioning report that can be inferred by diffing two DTSes.
* Edgar and Global Filer Manual validation
* Base Specification, Dimensions, Generic linkbase validation
* Formula validation
* RSS Watch facility
* Users can explore the functionality and features from either an interactive GUI
or command line interface, and can develop their own controller interfaces as
needed.

Contribute
==========
Arelle fully integrates test cases with the object models for XBRL instances and
DTSes.

This allows continual verification of tool performance as it is extended and
adapted by its users.

Arelle source code and bug tracker are hosted [on github](https://github.com/Arelle/Arelle)
