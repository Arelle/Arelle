This test checks the allowed files in groups according to family and version (i.e., release).</p>
<p>REMARK: This test leaves out USFRTF and ICI given that none of the other EDGAR validations apply to them.</p>

<td valign="top"><p>REMARK: There is no such section 6.22.3, these tests are just to verify that 2008 taxonomies work together but do
not work with the 2009 or subsequent taxonomies because of the XBRL 2.1 level conflict between roleType
declarations (when their allowed linkbases are included in the mix). Going forward, taxonomies of different
vintages are expected to coexist in a DTS without XBRL-level errors and this testcase will not be necessary.
However, other filing considerations mean that some taxonomies remain incompatible as listed below.</p></td>
