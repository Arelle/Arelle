id="label_Statistics">Statistics (&lt;) is a mathematical science pertaining to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data.[1] It also provides tools for prediction and forecasting based on data. It is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, from the natural and social sciences to the humanities, government and business.
Statistical methods can be used to summarize or describe a collection of data; this is called descriptive statistics. In addition, patterns in the data may be modeled in a way that accounts for randomness and uncertainty in the observations, and are then used to draw inferences about the process or population being studied; this is called inferential statistics. Descriptive, and inferential statistics (a.k.a predictive statistics) comprise applied statistics.[2]
There is also a discipline called mathematical statistics, which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject. Moreover, there is a branch of statistics called exact statistics that is based on exact probability statements.</link:label>
