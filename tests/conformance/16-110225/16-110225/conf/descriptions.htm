               </p>
               <p>Valid entries for the xlink:href attribute, the xsi:schemaLocation attribute and the schemaLocation attribute are document
                  locations. If they are relative URIs, they are subject to EDGARLink attachment naming conventions. Therefore, all documents
                  attached to the submission will be at the same level of folder hierarchy. By restricting the content of these attributes,
                  all documents in the DTS of an instance will be either a standard taxonomy or present in the submission.
               </p>
               <p>Examples:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>xlink:href="abccorp-20100123.xsd"</li>
                  <li>&lt;xsd:import schemaLocation="http://xbrl.org/2006/xbrldi-2006.xsd" namespace="..."/&gt;</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Counterexamples:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>xlink:href="http://www.example.com/2007/example.xsd"</li>
                  <li>xlink:href="#element(1/4)" (Comment: this is a scheme-based xpointer, not shorthand)</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The XHTML namespace is intentionally omitted, since an XHTML declaration could not be a valid target for any XBRL element's
                  xlink:href or schemaLocation attribute, and its presence in the xsi:schemaLocation attribute would not impact XBRL validation.
               </p>
               <p>There are dozens of other XBRL US GAAP Taxonomies documents to be used as templates to copy from during the preparation process,
                  but their inclusion in an EDGAR filing tends to load unused linkbases and therefore introduces unwarranted complications such
                  as unused extended links and a need for many prohibiting arcs. Reducing the amount of content in the DTS of the instance to
                  its essentials frees users to more easily link the submitted documents to the linkbases of their particular interest for analysis.

               <p>For example, a company with a May 31st, 2009 fiscal year end will have contexts whose end date time is midnight at the end
                  of 2008-05-31 (the prior fiscal year) and contexts whose start date-times are midnight at the beginning of 2008-06-01 (the

               <p>REMARK: this applies to all pairs of duration and instant contexts. It is not necessary to test a context's start and end
                  dates against itself because XBR2.1 section 4.7.2 requires that startDate is strictly less than end date.

               <p>REMARK: It is possible in principle that the measurement date for a public float or common shares outstanding might coincide
                  with the start date of a period. Although that situation has not yet been observed in practice, an appropriate way to carve
                  out an exception may appear in a future edition of the Manual.

                  Considering the status of the text as a kind of management assertion, well-formed XML is in the interest of the registrant

               <p>REMARK: In XML it is vital to distinguish the DOM from its various serializations. For a text block, the DOM node starts as
                  an element with one child text node; exactly one. It is that child text node that you now treat as a string, wrap lt;body&gt;
                  and &lt;/body&gt; around it, then re-parse and validate. See edbody.dtd; the grammar for the % Flow entity is clear.
               </p>
               <p>REMARK: By contrast, the content of a footnote according to XBRL 2.1 is any alternating sequence of text nodes and element
                  nodes drawn with names in the xhtml namespace. The serialization does not (and cannot) matter. The additional constraint on
                  footnotes imposed by EDGAR is that a footnote cannot just contain any old sequence of text and element DOM nodes. It has to
                  be a sequence of DOM nodes that would be valid if they were the children of a body node instead. You do not read the footnote
                  as a text node (that might have ampersands and angle brackets), as if it were itself a serialization. You take that sequence
                  of DOM nodes, make them the children of a &lt;body&gt; node and validate.

                  being that 6.7.27 would not apply to a standard taxonomy but 6.5.27 would still be an error. As long as all variations marked

                  identifies elements that belong to a particular markup vocabulary. However, since they function very differently, restrictions
                  that are placed on external references do not apply to namespaces. Since a particular instance document is expected to reference
                  multiple vocabularies, namespaces provide a convention by which each vocabulary is uniquely identified. This avoids problems
                  of recognition and collision of similarly named elements from different vocabularies appearing in XBRL documents.

               <p>Two syntax rules about elements with a type attribute equal to 'extended' ("extended-type links") require emphasis:</p>
               <ol>
                  <li>The scope of the xlink:label attribute is only its enclosing extended-type link. The xlink:label attribute does not function
                     like the XML id attribute, which must be unique in an entire document. Therefore, the same value of the xlink:label attribute
                     may appear on any number of elements, so long as those elements appear in different extended-type links.
                  </li>
                  <li>Two elements with a type attribute equal to 'arc' ("arcs") in the same extended-type link must not have the same values for
                     the xlink:from attribute and the xlink:to attribute, even if their xlink:arcrole attribute is different. However, this prohibition
                     against duplicate arcs is unrelated to any XBRL or EDGAR level syntax rule that forbids equivalent arcs (<a href="http://www.xbrl.org/Specification/XBRL-RECOMMENDATION-2003-12-31+Corrected-Errata-2008-07-02.htm#_3.5.3.9">XBRL 2.1 section 3.5.3.9.7.4</a>).
                  </li>
               </ol>
               <p>Reliance on these two rules of XLink syntax yields the meaning of the term 'base set' of arcs as defined in XBRL 2.1 and used

                  the beginning balance will appear simply as the ending balance of the previous period.

               <p>Tables define the rows and columns (the axes) that cells (the facts) may have. The domain-member arc role defines relationships
                  within each row or column, such as those between a parent entity and its reportable segments, among sets of classes of equity,
                  and or among geographical regions. Tables become difficult to consistently populate with facts and ambiguous to display when
                  elements can appear in more than one Domain (or Member). This rule ensures that any given element does not appear in more
                  than one place along an Axis, and will not have any overlapping domain subsets or members. In general, almost every situation
                  that at first appears to call for an Axis with tangled and overlapping subsets of Member elements actually turns out to be
                  a case more clearly modeled using two distinct axes.

                  A reference linkbase should only be attached to a submission when it is a copy of a linkbase published along with a schema
                  for early adopters. In that situation the schema would have a targetNamespace attribute of some authority other than the registrant
                  itself.

               <p>REMARK: There is no such section 6.22.3, these tests are just to verify that 2008 taxonomies work together but do not work
                  with the 2009 or subsequent taxonomies because of the XBRL 2.1 level conflict between roleType declarations (when their allowed
                  linkbases are included in the mix). Going forward, taxonomies of different vintages are expected to coexist in a DTS without
                  XBRL-level errors and this testcase will not be necessary.
