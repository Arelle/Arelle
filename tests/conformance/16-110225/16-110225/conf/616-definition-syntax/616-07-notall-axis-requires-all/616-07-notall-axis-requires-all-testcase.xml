<h2>An axis of a negative table must appear in a positive table in a definitionLink having an equal value of xlink:role.</h2>
<p>An Axis cannot appear as an Axis of a negative hypercube (that is, axis excluded from a table) unless there are members of that Axis
in a positive table. </p>
<p>Formally, an axis element that is the target of an effective relationship with arcrole equal to
'http://xbrl.org/int/dim/arcrole/hypercube-dimension' that is consecutive from a relationship with arc role
'http://xbrl.org/int/dim/arcrole/notAll' must also be the target of an effective relationship in a link:definitionLink having the same
value of xlink:role, and which itself is consecutive from an effective relationship with xlink:arcrole attribute equal to
'http://xbrl.org/int/dim/arcrole/all'.</p>
<p>An instance DTS in which the arc role 'http://xbrl.org/int/dim/arcrole/notAll' does not appear will not be affected by this rule.</p>
<p>REMARK: Ordinarily there would be a test here which would have a prohibited notAll arc somewhere; can't do that in this test because
no standard taxonomy has a notAll, and the prohibition on ineffectual arcs prevents me from putting one in here. So those were
variations 001 and 003 and they are not in here.</p>
<p>REMARK: This rule is intended to ensure that the notAll arc does not forbid members of a dimension that is not even relevant to a
hypercube. domain-member relationships between P1 and P2 are not relevant, since neither all nor notAll are ever consecutive from
domain-member. Note that the rule assumes, but does not require, that the target roles on HcDim1 and HcDim2 are different, so that the
members of Dim1 are different in HC1 and HC2.</p>
<p>REMARK: The rule, as written, fails to make explicit that the condition can only be evaluated with respect to some primary item;
without some primary item as a common ancestor, dimensions are irrelevant to each other. In variation 003ng,
the element EntityTaxIdentificationNumber has a notAll, but no all (and neither does any ancestor in that role).</p>
