resource, for now.  Also note that this only applies to a company extension linkbase.</p></td>

<p>REMARK: type='extended' is handled by XBRL 2.1 so this really only applies to type='resource', moreover, footnote and reference would
be handled by other rules so this is only for labels.</p>
<p>REMARK: This only applies to a company extension linkbase. There is no standard taxonomy linkbase that violates this rule, but if
there were, it would be included in a 'good' test variation.</p>
<p>REMARK: the roles declared in these tests have link:definition text that conforms to 6.7.12 even though 6.7.12 was only meant to
apply to roles that are used on link:presentation.</p>
