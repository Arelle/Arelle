### Contribution Guidelines and Standards

Before submitting your pull request for [review][github-pull-requests], make sure
your changes are consistent with the guidelines and follow the Arelle coding style.

[github-pull-requests]: https://github.com/arelle/arelle/pulls

#### General Guidelines and Philosophy for Contributions

* When you contribute a bug fix to Arelle, make sure to fully document the bug and
  how it was fixed in the PR. Additionally, supply possible ways that the fix could
  be manually tested. This will greatly improve the testing and time required to
  merge the fix.
* When you contribute a new feature or plugin to Arelle, make sure to include
  documentation in the code with a markdown file on how to use the feature/plugin
  and what benefit it provides.
* When you contribute a new feature or plugin to Arelle, make sure to point at the
  documentation in the PR and supply ways the new feature/plugin could be manually
  tested. This will make testing significantly easier for the Arelle team and reduce
  the time required to merge the feature.
* When you contribute a new feature or plugin to Arelle, the maintenance burden
  is (by default) transferred to the Arelle team. This means that the benefit
  of the contribution must be compared against the cost of maintaining the feature.

#### How To Craft a Good Commit Message

* Write one or more paragraphs with details, wrapped at 72 characters.
* Write in the present tense: "Fix bug" not "Fixed bug".
* Separate paragraphs with a single blank line.
* No markup, please! Commit messages should be plain text.

#### Include a License

Include a license at the top of new Python files ([example][python-license-example]).

[python-license-example]: https://github.com/Arelle/Arelle/blob/4e88da3b8e8edd368ffb50be01b7daf0324dda4c/arelle/plugin/validate/ESEF/__init__.py#L10

#### Python Coding Style

Stick to the [PEP8 guidelines][pep-0008] and use `mixedCase` for variable and function
names.
