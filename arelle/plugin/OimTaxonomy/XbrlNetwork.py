    name: QNameKeyType # (required if no extendedTargetName) The name is a QName that uniquely identifies the network object.
    relationshipTypeName: QName # (required if no extendedTargetName) The relationshipType object of the network expressed as a QName such as xbrl:parent-child
    roots: OrderedSet[QName] # (optional) A list of the root objects of the network object. This allows a single object to be associated with a network without the need for a relationship. The order of roots in the list indicates the order in which the roots should appear. If no root is specified for a list of relationships the roots property is inferred from the relationships defined.

    extendTargetName: Optional[QName] # (required if no name) Names the network object that the defined network relationships should be appended to. The items in the network with this property are appended to the end of the relationships or roots defined in the target network object. This property cannot be used in conjunction with the relationshipTypeName and name property.

    cycles: QName # (required) The cycles attribute indicates if the relationship when used in a hierarchy can include cycles. Possible values are any, none, and undirected. Any means cycles are allowed in the relationships, undirected means cycles are allowed, but they must be undirected, and none means cycles are not allowed in the relationships.

    targetObjects: set[QName] # (optional) Defines a list of target object types that can be used as the source for the relationship. The only permitted values are referenceable taxonomy objects
